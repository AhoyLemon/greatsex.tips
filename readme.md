### I have something I want to say about this website.
**If you're the coding type**, you should probably [subscribe to the project](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/greatsex.tips/subscription) and [follow Lemon](https://github.com/AhoyLemon) on GitHub. You can [fork this project](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/greatsex.tips/fork) if you like, but if you put in a [pull request](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/greatsex.tips/pull/new/master), know that your jokes will be looked over and (probably) edited.
